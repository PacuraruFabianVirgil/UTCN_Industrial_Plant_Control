Conclusion for active power and frequency:
The active power increases its value in order to assure a smooth frequency step response signal and compensate for the perturbation applied at t=150ms.

Conclusion for generator voltage control:
Both excitation voltage and excitation current signals increase their value in order to assure a smooth generator voltage signal and compensate for the perturbation applied at t=80ms.
